- Created a fully responsive map with its pointers. I didn't use any media queries for this responsiveness; I solved it with SVG.
- When clicked on the cards in the beginning it navigates the user to the details page.
- Because of some bug on my tailwind css compiler flex-row-reverse and flex-row don't work together with breakpoints, transport cards are a little off. ( can be solved with CSS)
- Was not able to think of a solution for the review section. My  implementations were always off so I decided to go with a simpler one
- I should have used more slider libraries before implementing my own sliders.
- Fully responsive for all sizes
